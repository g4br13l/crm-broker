# CRM Broker Project Rules

## Always consult these documentation files for complete project information:
- **`docs/techStackPatterns.md`** - Technology stack, coding patterns, naming conventions, and formatting rules
- **`docs/projectStructure.md`** - Complete project structure, directory conventions, and file organization patterns
- **`docs/productOverview.md`** - Project requirements and high-level description
- **`docs/features/`** - Feature-specific PRDs and requirements
- **`frontend/eslint.config.mjs`** - ESLint configuration and code style rules

## Consult these installed MCP servers for information about NextJs, Shadcn, any framework or library:
- context7
- next-devtools
- shadcn


## Recommendations
- Use `npm i` when installing new packages
- Use `npx shadcn add` to add new shadcn components
- Always use the most appropriated TypeScript Types
- Do not modify the colors and fonts defined in the `src/app/globals.css` file 
- You are no able to modify `.env` files directly, so tell the user how to do it
- Use the official documentation  (you can use the MCP installed for it)
- If you need more information to do this task, please, ask me all information you need
